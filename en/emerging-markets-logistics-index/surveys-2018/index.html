<p>Survey respondents were asked to rank the five emerging markets they viewed as having the most potential to grow as logistics markets over the next five years. A score was calculated in order to rank the markets – a first preference was awardedfive points, a second preference four points, and so on down to a single point for the fifth preference.</p>
<p>
There is much continuity between 2018 and 2017, with large markets remaining at the head of the list, indicating that market size remains a very important determinant of market potential.</p>
<p>
China and India remain by far the most compelling opportunities. China has reclaimed the top spot from India, though by a very slight margin. The result suggests that many have not been put off by predictions of a ‘hard landing’ for the Chinese economy. Its recent economic growth data and forecasts from institutions such as the IMF suggest it will continue to be the main locomotive of the world economy over the next five years or so. Despite warnings of a possible debt crisis (see China’s Emerging Narrative), industry professionals remain confident about the Chinese economy.</p>

<p>The top three drivers of growth in emerging logistics markets remained ‘Economic Growth’, ‘FDI’ and ‘Growing Trade Volumes’. Given the correlation between wider economic expansion and growing demand for logistics services, the continued emphasis placed on this as the top factor is not surprising. It is likely this will continue, with general economic growth playing an important role in encouraging spending within consumer markets, pulling larger amounts of the population into the middle class and increasing levels of public spending on infrastructure projects and other public services.</p>
<p>The fall of ‘Cheap Labour Force’ by two positions suggests there may be a growing perception that low-cost manufacturing as a model of economic development could be running out of steam.<br>
Aside from labour costs, manufacturers may be assigning more importance to other cost factors and broader considerations when making investment decisions. Going forward, this perhaps bodes well for countries that perform strongly in the Compatibility and Connectedness sub-indices. Technological advances and growing confidence in technology’s capacity to replace many manual operations might be another explanation for the drop of ‘Cheap Labour Force’ in this year’s Index.</p>
<p>The rise of ‘Strong Transport Infrastructure’ by two positions indicates that infrastructure development is increasingly perceived as a key enabler of economic activity. Poor infrastructure restricts logistics providers from transporting goods predictably and efficiently, holding back the development of formal logistics provision in emerging markets. ‘Poor Transport Infrastructure’ is also once again the second most important inhibitor to growth in emerging markets.</p>

<p>Countries from the Middle East and North Africa dominate the list of countries with the least potential to grow as logistics markets. Syria maintains the top position in the ranking, which comes as little surprise given the ongoing conflict, now into its sixth year. Lower oil prices and ISIS’s insurgency are likely behind Iraq’s rank of 2nd.</p>
<p>Ethiopia holds its position of 4th, which is at odds with results elsewhere. In a later question, Ethiopia climbed two positions to rank as the 5th most-promising logistics market in sub-Saharan Africa over the next five years. Its ambition to become a low-cost manufacturing hub has caught the eye of a number of investors. In particular, it is positioning itself as an alternative fashion &amp; textiles producer, competing against the likes of Bangladesh and Vietnam. It also has significant air freight operations with exports centred around flowers. Africa’s largest air cargo terminal recently opened at Addis Ababa airport. Ethiopia’s position as one of the least attractive emerging markets may be related to the ongoing threat of terrorism, especially in border areas with Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan, Sudan and Eritrea. While the security risk is lower in the capital, it is still deemed ‘high’ in all surrounding areas by a number of international authorities. The Somalia-based terrorist group Al-Shabaab has issued public threats against Ethiopia due to its involvement in military intervention in Somalia.</p>
<p>The most significant movement in the ranking relates to Venezuela, which climbed six positions to place 5th. Venezuela is the only South American country to place in the top 10 markets<br>
with the least potential. Its rise in this list coincides with its loss of four places in the Index, leaving it at No. 48. The country has declined across so many facets of society: its economy is tanking, hyperinflation is a reality, many are going hungry and corruption is the worst in the Western Hemisphere. To top it all off, in August 2017, Mercosur suspended Venezuela’s membership in the trading bloc for violating democratic principles and failing to comply with trade obligations. An already disastrous situation for freight forwarders worsened further.</p>
<p>Algeria has recorded the most significant improvement, falling three positions in the list to 11th. Its government has announced measures to control public spending and aims to reduce its dependence on oil. New laws designed to incentivise investment in non-oil sectors have been proposed, providing tax breaks and looser regulations. The hope is that ‘high value added’ sectors such as agribusiness, renewable energy, and ICT will be able to attract significant funding.</p>

<p>Intra-Asia remains the most-promising emerging market trade lane according to survey respondents. Home to some of the largest and fastest-growing economies in the world, intra-Asia trade continues to be strong as ‘factory Asia’, a complex web of supply chains primarily feeding China, becomes more entrenched. In addition to flourishing trade relationships with China, trade between other Asia Pacific countries is also predicted to increase significantly in the coming years. For instance, bilateral trade between Indonesia and Thailand has grown at an average of 10.5% annually during the past five years and is projected to be almost five times as high in 2030 as in 2009.</p>
<p>Asia-Europe maintains its position as the trade lane with the second-best potential for future growth, as the share of respondents selecting it as best increased by 1.7pp year-on-year. This perhaps reflects faith among respondents that demand from Europe for Asia’s exports will expand as its economic situation improves. In addition, at times in 2017, eastbound air freight tonnage on Europe-Asia services exceeded westbound volumes on certain key markets, confirming a long-term ‘re-balancing’ of the previous strong directional imbalance on key Far East-Europe markets. According to WorldACD, over the past six years, there was hardly any growth westbound from Asia Pacific to Europe, but in the opposite direction, volumes increased by an average of almost 40%. This has been attributed to increased purchasing power of the growing middle classes in Asia, especially in China. There has been growing demand for quality food, as well as high-value fashion garments, pharmaceuticals, and consumer products.</p>
<p>The relatively high degree of confidence in the growth potential of the Asia-Africa trade lane may be explained by investments made by Chinese government and business which has improved the scale and efficiency of Asia-facing logistics infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>The results also suggest that trade lanes connected to North America have worse prospects compared to last year. Short term pessimism for the Asia-North America trade lane is hard to explain, given North America’s strong economic performance in 2017. However, the United States’ withdrawal from TPP and fears of a trade war between China and the United States have perhaps clouded the outlook in the minds of respondents.</p>

<p><strong>Asia Pacific</strong></p>
<p>Economic shocks, poor infrastructure, corruption and natural disasters have been rated as the most significant supply chain risks across Asia Pacific for a third consecutive year. Overall, the four risks account for 72.0% of the total responses. While growth prospects remain positive for Asia Pacific, the survey’s results imply that economic shocks will pose the main threat to growth in the region. The dominance of this factor may suggest that respondents anticipate unexpected events to negatively impact the region’s positive outlook. This could relate specifically to the threat of a ‘hard landing’ in China, or to broader concerns around protectionism, for example.</p>
<p>Natural disasters are perceived as the fourth most threatening supply chain risk for the region. This factor dropped two positions, perhaps indicating that respondents have more faith in the ability of the governments of the region to introduce countermeasures to better prepare for future events. Climbing two positions compared to last year, ‘poor infrastructure’ was cited as the 2nd most significant supply chain risk across Asia Pacific. This is consistent with the rise of ‘strong transport infrastructure’ as a driver of growth in emerging logistics markets.</p>
<p><strong>Latin America</strong></p>
<p>Corruption and government instability remained the top two risks in Latin America, accounting for 63.8% of total responses, an increase of 4.5pp compared with the previous year. These findings come as little surprise in a year where corruption continued to make headlines across Latin America. Bribery of public officials and in public procurement as well as embezzlement of public funds remain prevalent.</p>
<p>Recent events in the region go a long way in explaining respondents’ particularly high ranking of government instability. Brazil’s numerous political and business corruption scandals have been well-documented, while disastrous governance in Venezuela has left many describing it as a failed state.</p>
<p><strong>Middle East and North Africa</strong></p>
<p>Terrorism and government instability once again ranked as the most significant supply chain risks across MENA, accounting for 63.6% of the total responses, although both factors accounted for a slightly lower proportion of total responses this year. The dominance of the two risk factors reflects ongoing conflicts and terrorism risk present in parts of the region.<br>
Economic shocks are quite a bit more important than last year, suggesting that respondents are becoming aware of the new realities in the region following the oil price crash. GCC countries<br>
have been buffeted by falling oil prices, leading to far-reaching consequences for businesses.</p>
<p>Similarly, the perception of ‘corruption’ as a supply chain risk across the Middle East and North Africa increased from 7.2% to 9.6%. The corruption purge in Saudi Arabia might be behind the rise in the share of this factor.</p>
<p>The perception of poor infrastructure as a supply chain risk to growth in Middle East &amp; North Africa continues to decline which is likely a result of vast investments in infrastructure across the region. These include the development of numerous special economic zones, ports and airports, leading many to suggest that the region actually has too many ‘mega hubs’, with some destined to be underutilised.</p>
<p><strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong></p>
<p>The perception of supply chain risks in sub-Saharan Africa is more or less unchanged year-on-year, with poor infrastructure, corruption and government instability making up the top three<br>
risks. Together, these risk factors account for 77.2% of total responses.</p>
<p>The most significant change is the 3.7pp rise in the proportion of respondents that suggested corruption as the gravest supply chain risk, echoing concerns that widespread graft continues to stifle development and remains a key barrier to foreign investment in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p>India and China remain the top two leading markets dominating investment plans over the next five years, however some change has occurred further down the list. Vietnam rose two positions to claim 3rd. Its prospects remain strong although relatively unchanged year-on-year. Its movement up may rather be due to less confidence in the markets it surpassed: the UAE and Brazil. The former has suffered as energy prices have slumped while Brazil has fallen two places to 5th as years of corruption and uncertainty in the political climate put off investors.</p>
<p>Myanmar has recorded the most significant improvement, rising 22 places to rank as the market with the 16th highest number of planned investments over the next five years. Logistics providers have ramped up investment there in recent years, opening new offices and logistics centres, and forming partnerships with local players. While there is much optimism around Myanmar’s economic development, there is also concern as hundreds of thousands of Rohingya, labelled by some as the “world’s most persecuted minority”, have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The Philippines’ rise follows a booming year for its economy in 2016, with container traffic at the Port of Manila up 13.8%. Like Indonesia (see its Emerging Narrative), Philippines has long been held back by inadequate infrastructure, but there seems to be renewed confidence that both archipelago countries are taking serious steps to overcome their deficits. For example, the largest container terminal at the Port of Manila has introduced an online container booking platform which has helped optimise truck movements in and out of the terminal. Capacity has also increased, and further investments are in the pipeline. Government spending on infrastructure in the first year of the Duterte administration was 5.4% of GDP, the highest level since the Marcos era before the 1990s, when the figure was 3.2%. It is expected to rise from 5.4% to 7.4% of GDP by the end of Duterte’s term in five years’ time, an increase of around 40%. Projects will be funded through a combination of tax reforms, public-private partnerships (PPPs), and overseas loans – mostly from China.</p>
<p>Bangladesh’s gain here coincides with it being the country that recorded the third-highest improvement in its Index score. Some are referring to it as the new ‘Asian Tiger’, a term which refers to the club of countries which experienced rapid growth between the 1960s and 1990s: Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. Bangladesh has averaged economic growth in excess<br>
of 6% over the past decade. Many reforms are needed however. The government is planning to cut red tape such that it takes seven days to start a business rather than 19.5, and reduce the time it takes for a company to connect to the national grid to 28 days from 404.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Mexico and Russia are major losers, dropping five and six positions respectively. Mexico’s drop may be related to uncertainty arising from the renegotiation of NAFTA. It has also downgraded its economic forecasts this year.</p>

						<h2>Amazon and Chinese Cross-border E-Commerce Logistics</h2>
<p><strong>Over the next 10 years, do you believe that Amazon will become a substantial player in Chinese cross-border e-commerce logistics?</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-4240 size-large" src="https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-amazon-china-presence-1024x530.png" alt="" width="1024" height="530" srcset="https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-amazon-china-presence-1024x530.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-amazon-china-presence-300x155.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-amazon-china-presence-768x398.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-amazon-china-presence-1200x622.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-amazon-china-presence.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>More than half of respondents believe that Amazon will establish a significant presence in Chinese cross-border e-commerce logistics over the next ten years.</p>
<p>Although Amazon entered China over a decade ago, it has largely missed the boat on e-commerce sales as the Chinese market is dominated by homegrown champions like Alibaba and JD. It is making a push to offer logistics services however. At present, through Amazon Logistics+, the company offers the ability to ship goods around the world by sea, land or air, essentially positioning itself as a freight forwarder. Its services also include packaging, warehousing, customs and handling services. Previously, manufacturers selling goods through Amazon had to deliver those goods directly to Amazon warehouses.</p>
<p>Amazon Logistics+ began importing ocean containers into the US from China in November 2016, and was bringing in between 10 and 15 containers a week on behalf of other customers as of<br>
April 2017. It also imports around 350 containers per week for its own use.</p>
<p>Perhaps such small volumes are why a significant minority, just 30.8%, believe that Amazon will only develop a “small” presence in Chinese cross-border e-commerce logistics over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Amazon has also made logistics investments in the US, leasing its own air cargo fleet and purchasing truck trailers. It has also recruited a number of logistics industry veterans.</p>
<p>Only a very small proportion of respondents (8.8%) believe that Amazon will be the market leader in Chinese cross-border e-commerce logistics, which perhaps reflects thinking that Amazon’s e-commerce sales will never be that large in China, therefore it will not bother to seriously try and take on leading LSPs.</p>

<p><strong>What impact do you think Brexit will have on emerging markets?</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-4242 size-large" src="https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-brexit-1024x511.png" alt="" width="1024" height="511" srcset="https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-brexit-1024x511.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-brexit-300x150.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-brexit-768x383.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-brexit-1200x598.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-brexit.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>The dominant view among survey respondents (44.6%) is that emerging markets will be more or less unaffected by Brexit. One possible explanation for this view might be that many emerging<br>
markets’ economic exposure to the UK is just not that large.</p>
<p>Slightly more than a quarter of respondents (25.4%) believe that emerging markets stand to gain from Brexit. Indeed, there is hope that Brexit will lead to a string of new trade agreements between the UK and emerging markets. Such agreements appear most likely to be agreed first with English-speaking countries, where legal systems and trade objectives are closely aligned, so that there is likely to be less opportunity for misunderstandings and mistakes. Smaller negotiating partners will probably make for easier agreements, rather than larger markets such as China or India which will demand greater concessions. That said, even relatively small emerging markets may be able to punch above their economic weight to secure preferential trade deals with the UK if British politicians are desperate to make Brexit look like a success.</p>
<p>Separately, there appears to be scope for disagreements between the UK and EU on one side and potentially a whole host of countries on the other over the issue of tariff rate quotas (TRQs). TRQs specify that limited quantities of imports are allowed into a country duty-free or at low duty. Quantities beyond those limits are charged higher duties. They typically apply to agricultural goods; the EU has around 100 on various foodstuffs. On October 12, the EU and UK submitted a joint approach to the WTO on how it proposed to split their TRQs post-Brexit.</p>
<p>Soon after, opposition emerged from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, Thailand, the United States and Uruguay. They argue the proposal would leave them worse off. For lamb, the EU currently has a TRQ of 300,000 tonnes. The seven countries argue that post-Brexit, the split of the quota between the UK and EU should exceed 300,000 tonnes, because the commercial value is reduced as they have less flexibility to choose where to export. This impasse is by no means a disaster, it just means that any hopes that TRQs could be sorted out quickly have been dashed – months of negotiations will follow. Trade negotiations are almost never quick or easy, and if they are, it usually means one side capitulated.</p>

<p><strong>Which of the following statements best reflects your strategy for sub-Saharan Africa?</strong></p>

<p>A total of 54.9% of survey respondents stated that expanding operations in sub-Saharan Africa is not in their plans. Of this, 32.2% stated that they do not operate in, or plan to operate in sub-Saharan Africa, which represents a 7.3pp increase year-onyear. 22.7% indicated that they do not have immediate plans to establish operations in the region, a 1.8pp decrease compared to last year. At the other end of the spectrum are those respondents that have already established operations and are looking at strategic growth opportunities (20.4%), as well as those respondents (24.7%) who are planning to establish operations in the region.</p>
<p>Overall, the results indicate diametrically opposite positions between those who do not consider the sub-Saharan markets to have compelling opportunities for LSPs and those who eye expansion in the region. This split seems to reflect the dilemma that investors are likely to be faced with when evaluating the investment opportunities in the region. On the one hand, the region exhibits considerable growth, buoyed by the rising middle class and abundant natural resources. On the other, a whole host of issues related to poor infrastructure, connectivity and more generally the ability to do business effectively persist, putting off investors and making it difficult to run modern logistics operations in some locations. It is not surprising therefore that some LSPs shy away from investing in Africa whilst others decide to take on the challenges and embrace the opportunities the region has to offer.</p>

<p>A significant degree of continuity was seen year-on-year in survey respondents’ perception of the most-promising emerging markets in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana have each maintained their positions in the top four. South Africa remains the undisputed leader when it comes to growth opportunities for LSPs. This possibly reflects the fact that it has the best infrastructure and connectivity of all the Sub-Saharan African markets in the Index.</p>
<p>Ethiopia climbed two positions, resulting in it being the 5th most-promising logistics market in sub-Saharan Africa over the next five years. This result may suggest that the Ethiopian government’s bid to become a low-cost manufacturing hub has boosted the country’s potential as a logistics market. Ethiopia has set itself an ambitious target of becoming the leading manufacturing hub in Africa, as part of its Vision 2025 agenda.</p>
<p>Indeed, the government of Ethiopia has taken steps to develop its textile and garment industries. A number of manufacturers from China, South Korea, India and other countries have decided to open new plants in the country, while a growing number of European and US brands are sourcing garments there. Respondents may also have taken note of the opening of a railway line between Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa and Djibouti.</p>
<p>Ethiopia uses Djibouti’s ports for most of its imports and exports. The time to transport a container from Addis Ababa to Djibouti should fall from three days to 10 hours and the cost is expected to be slashed by a third. Officials say each freight train could transport the same cargo as 200 trucks.</p>

						<h2 class="ms-rteElement-H1">Inhibitors of Logistics Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa</h2>
<p><strong>Survey question: What do you perceive to be the biggest challenge prohibiting the emergence of Africa’s logistics market?<br>
</strong><br>
<img class="alignleft wp-image-4253 size-large" src="https://demo.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-inhibit-logistics-growth-1024x462.png" alt="" width="1024" height="462" srcset="https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-inhibit-logistics-growth-1024x462.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-inhibit-logistics-growth-300x135.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-inhibit-logistics-growth-768x346.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-inhibit-logistics-growth-1200x541.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>Growth in the middle class and consumer spending remains the top driver of Sub-Saharan Africa’s logistics markets according to survey respondents.</p>
<p>There appears to be a meaningful shift in the perception of Sub-Saharan African infrastructure. ‘Rapid infrastructure growth’ increased its share of those who thought it was the top driver of African logistics growth from 15.2% to 21.4%, while the share of those who perceived infrastructure as the biggest inhibitor fell from 32.7% to 26.3%. Perhaps supply chain professionals have faith that infrastructure is meaningfully improving in the region.</p>
<p>The growth effects of narrowing Sub-Saharan Africa’s infrastructure quantity and quality gap are potentially large. According to the World Bank, growth of GDP per capita for the region would increase by an estimated 1.7pp per year if it were to close the gap with the median of the rest of the developing world.</p>
<p>Closing the infrastructure quantity and quality gap relative to the best performers in the world could increase growth of GDP per capita by 2.6% per year. The largest potential growth benefits would come from closing the gap in electricity-generating capacity.</p>
<p>Another significant movement is the big drop in ‘new oil and gas discoveries’ as the most important driver of African logistics growth. It fell from being the choice of 24.4% of respondents in last year’s survey to just 8.1% this year, and is now considered as one of the least significant drivers of growth in the region. The slide probably reflects the collapse in the oil price, which has now filtered through in terms of perception, and perhaps a belief that oil prices are set to remain relatively low over an extended period.</p>

						<h2 class="ms-rteElement-H1">East Africa as the Next Low-Cost Manufacturing Hub</h2>
<p><strong>East African countries are trying to emulate the success of markets like Vietnam and Bangladesh by creating low-wage manufacturing jobs. Can East Africa attract investment and emerge as a low-wage manufacturing centre?</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-4255 size-large" src="https://demo.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-east-africa-next-hub-1024x558.png" alt="" width="1024" height="558" srcset="https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-east-africa-next-hub-1024x558.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-east-africa-next-hub-300x164.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-east-africa-next-hub-768x419.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-east-africa-next-hub-1200x654.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-east-africa-next-hub.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>Overall, 75.7% of respondents asserted that, to one extent or another, East Africa will emerge as a low-wage manufacturing centre in time. Of these, the majority (42.4%) believe that East Africa will in time develop a low-wage manufacturing industry, but on a far smaller scale compared to Bangladesh or Vietnam. About one-third (33.3%) believe that East Africa will in time develop a low-wage manufacturing industry, in a similar vein to Bangladesh or Vietnam.</p>
<p>Just 14.3% thought that East Africa would not succeed in this regard because low-wage manufacturing as a development model has run out of steam, while 10% thought it would not emerge for other reasons.</p>
<p>These sunny predictions about East Africa’s future are somewhat at odds with results reported in a previous question. Ethiopia appeared 4th in the list of emerging markets that respondents believe have the least potential to grow as logistics markets.</p>
<p>The optimism conveyed might be based on the rising interest among manufacturers in East African countries as potential sourcing destinations for apparel. The governments of both Ethiopia and Kenya in particular are taking steps to develop their textile and garment industries.</p>
<p>Two comments provided by respondents summarise the opposing views on offer.</p>
<p>One stated: “In the long run these countries will be able to learn out of the story of Bangladesh and Vietnam. Africa will eventually catch up with South-East Asian countries.”</p>
<p>Another remarked: “Low wages just produce poor societies, and that’s not a good path for the success of markets.”</p>

						<h2>TIndia’s Economic Reforms and Impact on Investment</h2>
<p><strong>Has the passing of reform, including the Goods &amp; Services Tax, changed your plans to invest in India?</strong></p>

<p>While last year’s survey results revealed that the passing of the Goods &amp; Services Tax (GST) did have a significant impact on respondents’ investment plans for India, this year’s results paint a much more convincing picture.</p>
<p>Over a third (37.4%) of respondents now view India as a market they’d consider investing in thanks to economic reforms, up from 22.8% last year. In addition, the share of respondents asserting that they’re no more or less likely to invest in India than before fell to 21.5% from 30.9%.</p>
<p>GST was rolled out on July 1, 2017, simplifying the existing federal, state, and local indirect tax structure. By unifying over ten types of indirect taxes into one tax and simplifying collection, GST is expected to be a game changer for Indian logistics, due to the indirect impact it will have on the sector through its positive economic impact, as well as the direct impact it will have as it incentivises logistics networks to be operationally optimised rather than tax optimised (see India’s Emerging Narrative for more).</p>

<p>Despite a reduction in the share of respondents citing ‘Poor governance’ as the biggest barrier to higher growth, this factor remains the biggest obstacle to Brazil’s growth this year. ‘Corruption’, on the other hand, saw an increase of 8.0pp. Together, the two factors account for 69.9% of responses, a year-on-year increase of 2.8pp.</p>
<p>It is clear that Brazil remains in crisis. The economy has suffered a huge recession, with real incomes per capita down by 9% between 2013 and 2016. Its fiscal position is unsustainable. Above all, a corruption scandal has consumed the political elite and leading businessmen.</p>

<p>More than half of respondents (56.1%) believe that SMEs will grow fastest in emerging markets over the next five years, as opposed to 26.2% who envisage faster growth in large companies.</p>
<p>Almost one-fifth (17.8%) think that they will grow at about the same rate. Some respondents were keen to assert the interdependence between SMEs and large companies, with one noting: “Some SMEs will be able to benefit out of the expanding economic boom stirred by large companies”, while another remarked “Large multinationals are usually the first and then they create a network of local suppliers.”</p>
<p>At least in India, SMEs have been growing faster. A report from the Reserve Bank of India found that SMEs’ sales in India grew by 12% in 2015 whereas listed big companies grew by just 1.4%. One respondent hinted that SMEs may have an advantage due to their agility, stating: “Being able to adapt to any and all situations is the key to survival in emerging markets. Things change in a flash. If the decision maker has to be consulted, he/she should be easy to reach.”</p>
<p>Across emerging markets however, it is generally unclear whether SMEs are growing faster than large companies.</p>
<p>What is not in doubt is that large companies play a very important role as customers for logistics providers. According to Caroline Freund of the Peterson Institute, based on research of 32 emerging markets, the top firm typically accounts for 15% of non-oil exports. The top ten tends to represent about 40%.</p>

<p>Survey respondents had very mixed views on how the renegotiation of NAFTA will affect Mexican trade volumes. About a quarter believe trade will be left broadly unchanged (25.7%). Slightly less (24.3%) think Mexico’s trade with both its NAFTA partners will benefit from the renegotiation, while 21.8% believe Mexico’s trade with both partners will suffer. A very similar share (19.9%) selected that Mexico will boost its trade with Canada as its volumes with the US suffer. Just 8.3% think that the renegotiation will boost Mexican trade volumes with the US but hurt its trade with Canada.</p>
<p>There is a somewhat clearer picture if the results are aggregated. 32.6% think the renegotiation will positively impact Mexico’s trade volumes with the US, while 41.7% envisage a negative impact. That a greater proportion believe Mexico’s trade with the US will be hurt is perhaps not surprising given the Trump administration’s rhetoric around bringing back manufacturing jobs to the US.</p>
<p>Overall, the results are not conclusive one way or the other. This is broadly in line with prior expectations. If the renegotiations fail, it is a no-brainer that trade volumes will suffer. However, if an agreement is reached, it really is not clear what the impact on trade will be. There are many variables in play, not least possible changes to NAFTA’s rules of origin chapter, as explored in our Mexico Emerging Narrative.</p>
<p>From a US perspective, rules of origin specify that for a good to be imported tariff-free from Canada or Mexico, a certain proportion of its value must be produced within NAFTA. For a car, the threshold is 62.5%. The White House is proposing to increase the NAFTA share to 85%, and add a requirement for 50% US content. Generally, the logic goes that as the content share increases, more trade should take place within NAFTA, given the desire to qualify for free trade. Cheaper car parts from<br>
Asia or Europe may be rejected in favour of more expensive NAFTA components. But as the benchmark increases, there comes a point when it becomes cheaper to import parts from outside NAFTA and pay the tariff on the finished vehicle anyway. The impact on trade flows is therefore unclear.</p>

						<h2>Prospects for Emerging Market Growth</h2>
<p><strong>The IMF forecasts 2018 emerging market growth of 4.8%. In your opinion, is this:</strong><br>
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4268" src="https://demo.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-emerging-market-growth-prospects-300x165.png" alt="" width="300" height="165" srcset="https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-emerging-market-growth-prospects-300x165.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-emerging-market-growth-prospects-768x423.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-emerging-market-growth-prospects-1024x563.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-emerging-market-growth-prospects-1200x660.png,https://www.agility.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-emerging-market-growth-prospects.png" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>Almost two-thirds of supply chain professionals (65.1%) think the IMF’s 2018 economic growth forecast for emerging markets of 4.8% is about right. Around one-third (33.0%) think this prediction is too optimistic. A year ago, 42.8% thought the IMF’s 4.6% forecast for 2017 was excessive. Hardly any (1.9%) expect the 2018 forecast to be meaningfully exceeded.</p>
<p>That almost a third see the forecast as too optimistic is perhaps a reflection of various economic risks, which the IMF maintain are still skewed to the downside.</p>
<p>These include a faster and greater tightening of global financial conditions, which may well transpire if the US increases its base rate sooner than expected or by more than anticipated. The institution also warns of possible financial turmoil in emerging markets if China fails to counter risks associated with the expansion of credit. If a shock occurs that causes a growth slowdown in China, this would have adverse consequences for other economies through weaker trade, commodity prices and confidence. The IMF also states that there is a chance that a shift towards more protectionist policies would reduce trade and cross-border investment flows, harming global growth.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the IMF also asserts that “momentum could prove to be more durable than expected amid strong consumer and business confidence, for instance, in the euro area and in East Asia, and near-term growth could exceed the forecast.”</p>
<p>As ever, logistics providers in emerging markets should expect the unexpected, be prepared to deal with volatility and take a long-term view when investing or expanding. Those hoping for a smooth ride are likely to be sorely disappointed.</p>
