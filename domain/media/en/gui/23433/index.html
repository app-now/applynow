<h1>To Make a Report</h1>
You may use either of the following two methods to submit a report:
<ul>
<li>Dial toll-free, within the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico and Canada:
<br />
<strong>800-472-6986</strong>
<br /><br />
Outside of the United States, Guam, Puerto Rico and Canada:
<br />
<strong><a href="phone.html">Click here for dialing instructions</a></strong>
<br /><br />
OR
<br /><br />
</li>
<li>Select the <strong>"Make a Report"</strong> link at the left of this web page.</li>
</ul>
After you complete your report you will be assigned a unique code called a "report key." Write down your report key and password and keep them in a safe place. After <strong>5-6</strong> business days, use your report key and password to check your report for feedback or questions.

The Agility Compliance division is dedicated to ensuring that all employees are familiar with and act in accordance to sound ethical behavior. Our goal is to make sure that all employees are aware of and follow all ethical business practices outlined in the Agility Code of Business Ethics and Conduct to ensure the integrity of our people, processes and assets.
<br /><br />
At Agility, we act, adhere to and possess high professional standards in all dealings with colleagues, customers, suppliers, the community and all other stakeholders.
<br /><br />
As such, we value your input.  This is why we have established multiple methods to allow you to voice your concerns or questions. You can either bring the concern to attention of your manager, a Compliance Officer, or the Human Resources department. If you are uncomfortable reporting to the proceeding contacts, we provide a toll free call line or by using this intranet site for reporting your concerns or misconduct. The information you provide will be on a totally confidential and anonymous basis.
